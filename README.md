# AI-coursework
Coursework from artificial intelligence unit studied in final year of computer science degree. 

The assignment was to use MATLAB to create a series of outputs from a dataset. These were directly compared with ones given in the brief and expected to match. For this assignment I was granted a first-class mark of 80% 

It is split into 5 sections:
	1. Dataset preparation 
  2. Feature space visualisation 
  3. Abstraction visualisations 
  4. Classifier re-implementations 
  5. Extension to ensembles
